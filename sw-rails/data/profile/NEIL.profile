profile			= Neil Mariott-Smith was born in to Gloucestershire pig farming, the illegitimate son of a wealthy landowner and a beautiful German Shepherd called Mildred. He soon found his two callings in life to be cricket and moving bits of paper around a table with a pencil (i.e. hospital accounts). His most spectacular moment was when the ball was struck soundly for what seemed like could only be six runs. Neil, tail wagging, dropped his squeaky bone and launched himself seven feet in the air to catch the ball. It took the rest of the team ten minutes of chasing him a round the pitch to get the it back, drenched in saliva and covered with teeth marks though it was.
