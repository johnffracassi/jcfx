profile 		= A pugnacious right-handed batsmen who has served both HECC and Steamboat Willies CC with great distinction. Favouring his 9-iron "over the top shot" in both forms of the game, over the years this accomplished batsmen has scored several innings well into the high single figures. Greatest achievement is being first at the pub for any drinks nights (unfortunately for him the pub doesn't open till 11am) as well as being the current holder of the 'best ever over' for Steamboat Willies CC.
