		<h1>Steamboat Willies News</h1>

		<h3>27-Mar-2011</h3>
		Congratulations Steamboat Willies on winning yet another premiership. It's not official yet, but I've
		heard rumours that the Steamboat Willies are now the most successful indoor cricket team in the Commonwealth.
		
		<h3>Sri-Lanka Tour</h3>
		Tentative dates for the Australian tour of Sri-Lanka are floating around (see <a href="http://www.wavingtheflag.com/tour.asp?TourID=54">here</a>).
		There's talk of an epic Steamboat Willies Adventure (an SWA is the equivalent of a multi-week AGM), if you're keen, 
		email me (jeffcann@gmail.com) with the matches you're interested in.<br/>
		<b>Registered thusfar</b>: Jeff (ODI 4&amp;5, Test 1&amp;2), Nightbus (Test 2&amp;3 OR ODI 4&amp;5,Test 1)
		
		<h3>26-Mar-2011</h3>
		RIP, one of the original Steamboats. Dickie got married today...
