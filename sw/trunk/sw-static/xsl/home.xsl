		<h1>Steamboat Willies News</h1>

		<h3>13-May-2010 - Superleague Round 3</h3>
		I didn't play, but the scoresheet didn't look pretty...<br/>
		Can recycle half of the previous weeks report - "Steamboat Willies were slightly outclassed
		to record the second biggest defeat in Steamie History", this time 137 runs. Previous weeks MotM faired
		slightly worse this time round with a -45, closely followed by K-Dog on -37. Blue Light Dillo put in a
		statistically awesome performance with a +7. Which reminds me of a formula he once told me... Double your age + 7 = acceptable

		<h3>6-May-2010 - Superleague Round 2</h3>
		After an emphatic victory in the first Super-League game of the season, Steamboat Willies were slightly outclassed
		to record the second biggest defeat in Steamie History (119 runs). Man of the Match Rob finished with a -2, while
		slightly further down the table was Jeff and Jess contributing -26 each.<br/>
		<u>Super-League lesson #1</u>: If you appeal confidently, you don't need the ball in the hand to run someone out. Helps
		if the umpire is your mate though...
				
		<h3>World Domination - Phase 1</h3>
		Following on from the reasonably successful World Ice Cricket Club Championships, we are taking on the mighty ICC affiliated 
		<a href="http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/icc_members/profile.php?countryCode=ICC_AFFILIATE_MEMBERS_EST">Estonian national team</a>.
