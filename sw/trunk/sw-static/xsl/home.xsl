		<h1>Steamboat Willies News</h1>

		<h3>15th April - New Season Starts (Superleague)</h3>

		<h3>9th April 2010 - AGM</h3>
		Motion passed to change the "I" in Steamboat Willies ICC from <b>Indoor</b> to <b>International</b> to reflect our change in
		direction and broaden our worldy appeal.<br/>
		Another motion was passed to change Rocket's official nickname to <b>Red Rocket</b>
		(<a href="http://www.tubeit.se/video/190/South-Park--Red-rocket">Click here for explanation</a>)
		
		<h3>8th April 2010 - Local Derby</h3>
		Jeff's Dreamboat Willies (Jumbo, Max, Jesse, Neil, JZ, Stu, Shakiran)  destroyed the 
		Old Man's Tugboat Willies (Mick, Super-G, Special-K, Red Rocket, Dillo, Owen, Sunil) 
		in a typical bitter and often spiteful local derby.
		The Dreamboats batted first (because a couple of homos in Mick's team wanted to watch the football) and amassed what looked 
		like an under-par score on a good batting track. Nothing special in the innings, apart from some dubious mid-innings 
		Mankad related rule-bending. Set just 69 (toot-toot!) for victory, the Tugboats capitulated. The Fulham Benders put on a waste-of-time 2 runs
		for the first partnership, and after declaring the match ineligible for stats, Captain Mick sailed his team into 
		even more uncomfortable waters, contributing -20 for his first over. From then on the game was as good as over, the only consolation
		for the Tugboats was Mick redeeming innings of 31 when he was asked to bat again.	 
		
		<h3>World Domination - Phase 1</h3>
		Following on from the reasonably successful World Ice Cricket Club Championships, we are taking on the mighty ICC affiliated
